# Neutrosophic Cubic Sets

## INTRODUCTION

  Neutrosophic set theory is a mathematical framework designed to deal with information that is uncertain, incomplete, or inconsistent. 
  Unlike traditional set theory, which assumes elements are either in or out of a set, neutrosophic sets introduce a third component: Indeterminacy, in addition to Truth and Fallacy.
  The idea of Neutrosophic Cubic sets and some of its operations is discussed in the paper [click here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283501088_The_theory_of_neutrosophic_cubic_sets_and_their_applications_in_pattern_recognition)
